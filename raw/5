In this eight-month program, I would be eligible for CPHR designation. Internationally as well as in India this has a great value and helps achieve a higher salary and better positions. This eight-month program is much more economical compared to a twenty-four-month program in India, not only do I save money I am also able to save sixteen months, which would get me salaries and savings once on return to  India almost equal to my investment made in education for Canada
