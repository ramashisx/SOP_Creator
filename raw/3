I completed high school with an 8.2 CGPA in 2016, senior secondary education with 84% in 2018, and finished a Bachelor of Arts degree with 66% in 2021. I was part of the state and national Wrestling and Taekwondo sports team during my school days and won many medals. Sports taught me perseverance and discipline. It taught me the importance of training, teamwork, motivation, and delivering results.
I have always loved learning and studying new things. So, when I graduated from high school with excellent grades, I was excited to begin my college education. I studied various subjects in college, but psychology was my favourite. I found the subject fascinating and enjoyed learning about the human mind and its behaviour in its surroundings. My average marks in psychology were higher than in any other subject.
I loved learning about different psychological theories and concepts. So, when I graduated in Arts from college, I decided to pursue a career in human resource management as it has its foundation in psychology. It involves studying and understanding human behaviour, organizational behaviour, and motivation in the workplace. It is an area that has always interested me.
I learned Psychometric analysis and Aptitude tests in the practicals conducted in Psychology, and similar Psychometric assessments of employees and 360-degree appraisals are based on the psychological processes of improving team dynamics. Psychological theories like Maslow's helps to understand employee needs. Employee counselling and conflict resolution in HRM involves Psychology.
This year, from January 2022 to March 2022, I also did a three-month non-paid internship in HR with a recruitment firm. I learned how to extract resumes from job portals, shortlist candidates, interview them, and select employees. It was a fantastic learning experience. The internship motivated me further to specialize in Human Resource Management.
