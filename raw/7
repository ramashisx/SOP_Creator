Other than the tremendous job prospects, there are other reasons to return to India:
    • My parents and grandparents are very attached to me, and this one year of studies of mine would be an emotional wreck for them. As soon as I finish my advanced diploma in HRM, I will join them back.
    • Soon my parents will retire, and I need to offer them emotional support while I establish my career in India upon my return.
    • Besides, my parents are patriotic Indians steeped in their cultural ethos. All their movable and immovable assets are in India. Even I have no intention of staying back in Canada, abandoning my rich heritage and the legacy that awaits me in the future.
    • I need to return to inherit my parent's properties which have a very high value. Kindly referred the CA report attached.
