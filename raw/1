Subject: Statement of Purpose / Explanation regarding previous student visa refusal
Dear Sir/ Madam,
I wish to provide the following additional information supporting my application for a student visa.
I, Barman Singh, bearing passport number PL787393, applied for Human Resource Management program at the Robertson College-Winnipeg. Assiniboine Community College (DLI No. O1912845642282) is Offering this program in partnership with Robertson College, Winnipeg, Manitoba. Unfortunately, my application got refused for March 2022 intake; the reasons mentioned in my refusal letters were:
    1. Visa Officer feels that they are not satisfied that I will leave Canada at the end of the stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on the purpose of your visit".
 I was very disappointed with the refusal I received as I realized that I had failed to convey my purpose of visiting Canada. This led to the impression that I was planning to stay back in Canada after completing the course. However, my goal in visiting Canada is solely academic. Therefore, I have decided to reapply for the Post-Secondary Advanced Diploma program in Human Resource Management where the minimum eligibility as per the website was of being a graduate. In this application, I have explained my plans to address the issue raised by the previous visa officer.
