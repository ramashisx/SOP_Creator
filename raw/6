Reason to Return
After completing my program, I would return to India with an international diploma in human resource management. I would be the most sought-after talent. India is the most emerging economy globally, and it offers job opportunities for those in the human resources industry. 
The human resource industry in India is booming, thanks to the country's ever-growing population. Every year, 18 million people enter the workforce, presenting many opportunities for HR professionals. This "demographic dividend" boosts the economy, as businesses can benefit from the labour pool. The Ernst & Young survey showed that the human resource industry has grown at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 21% over the past four years.
With an improvement in the economic scenario, there have been investments across various sectors of the economy. The private equity - venture capital sector recorded assets worth US$ 6.8 billion across 102 deals in November 2021, which were 42% higher than November 2020. The result would lead to more improvement in employability. India will likely become a $5 trillion economy by 2025-26 or 2026-27 if the GDP grows at around 8 percent. Information Technology, Healthcare, telecommunications, Infrastructure, and Retail will see a significant boom in employment, and government initiatives will see the expansion of companies and start-ups.
This growth will continue in the years ahead as more people enter the workforce. The Human Resource Managers are needed across various HR functions to manage these human resources.
Human Resource Management is a critical function in any organization, but it is essential in India, given the vast and diverse population of the country. The Human Resource Manager needs to navigate complex cultural issues while also ensuring that employees are engaged relatively and equitably. The Human Resource Manager has a lot of responsibility. They help create a positive work environment where employees are productive. They have a crucial role in ensuring that the company meets its objectives. The various HR functions revolve around.
    • Human Resource Planning
    • Job Function Design
    • Recruitment and Selection
    • Orientation and Induction
    • Training and Development
    • Performance Appraisal
    • Compensation Planning and
Remuneration
    • Motivation, Welfare, Health, and
Safety

Post Program completion and return to India, as I shall be the most sought-after talent in India, Companies would offer me roles as Human Resource Manager, Recruitment Manager, and Payroll Manager. 
The leading companies that hire talent like me are TCS, TATA Projects, Wipro, Cognizant, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis, L &T InfoTech, Mindtree, C-DAC, Reliance Group. Aditya Birla Group Unilever, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Parle Agro, Amul India. In another five years, I can grow from an HR manager to an HR head as I would have more advantages than the other candidates because of my international exposure.
