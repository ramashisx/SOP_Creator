Conclusion:

I have presented all the necessary details regarding my return plans to India in this document and have been able to resolve the concerns of the last visa officer. My sole purpose in coming to Canada is education only, as I need to leverage my profile for the competitive Indian job market with a globally recognized degree. I need to pursue the advanced Human Resource Management program in Canada to get the right direction for my profile. I, therefore, request you to re-evaluate my application.

I am looking for a positive response from your end for my visa application in light of the reasons mentioned above and grant me a student visa.

Sincerely
Barman Singh
