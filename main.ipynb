      "I, Ali babar, applied for Computer Engineering Technician program at the Northern College-Pures Campus. Assiniboine Community College (DLI No. X1430345457535) is Offering this program in partnership with Northern College, Canada . Unfortunately, my application got refused for March 2022 intake; the reasons mentioned in my refusal letters were:\n",
      "    1. Visa Officer feels that they are not satisfied that I will leave Canada at the end of the stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on the purpose of your visit\".\n",
      " I was very disappointed with the refusal I received as I realized that I had failed to convey my purpose of visiting Canada. This led to the impression that I was planning to stay back in Canada after completing the course. However, my goal in visiting Canada is solely academic. Therefore, I have decided to reapply for the Post-Secondary Advanced Diploma program in Human Resource Management where the minimum eligibility as per the website was of being a graduate. In this application, I have explained my plans to address the issue raised by the previous visa officer.\n"
